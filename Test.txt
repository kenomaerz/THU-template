Familiarize yourself with your topic
•List open questions / unclear points
•Distribute open questions to team members
•Document answers

Work Plan

•Your project description is not super clear
•That’s how it usually is :/
•First step: Clarify your work packages!

•Create a work plan
•Create a list of work packages that need to be done
•Create larger topics and list small, well defined packages!
•Maybe use a tool to manage work packages!
•Trello, Meistertask, Githubissues...
•Make an appointment with me and present your work plan (30 min)
